## Hello, there..

First of all, welcome to my GitHub :)

There is a little intro to let you know what to expect:

  - Currently i'm learning about React and Node, so you will probably see a lot of this around here
  - There are some school work and old stuff as well, never mind
  - I'm Brazilian, so a lot of information will be in brazilian portuguese
  - I don't know much, but i'm always trying to learn something new

Thats it. Hope you find what you looking for..
